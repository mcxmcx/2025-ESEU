This file contains the data used for the manuscript submitted to Environmental Sciences Europe (ESEU), entitled “Trapping of microplastic particles in Germany’s largest drinking water reservoir – a simulation study”. The dataset includes observed water temperature profiles in the Rappbode Reservoir for the years 2015 and 2016, the corresponding simulations from the calibrated CE-QUAL-W2 model, and the microplastic simulation results for 4 scenarios (i.e., sinking velocities ranging from 0.1m d⁻¹, 0.2m d⁻¹, 0.9m d⁻¹ and 1.0m d⁻¹). Due to file size limitations, please contact me if you require the results of the other scenarios.    
For any questions regarding the manuscript and the data, please directly contact the corresponding author, Dr. Chenxi Mi (chenxi.mi@ufz.de), once the manuscript has been accepted for publication.
