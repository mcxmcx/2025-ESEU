This file contains the data used for the manuscript submitted to Environmental Sciences Europe (ESEU), entitled “Trapping of microplastic particles in Germany’s largest drinking water reservoir – a simulation study”. The dataset includes observed water temperature profiles in the Rappbode Reservoir for the years 2015 and 2016, the corresponding simulations from the calibrated CE-QUAL-W2 model, and the microplastic simulation results for all 10 scenarios (i.e., sinking velocities ranging from 0.1 m d⁻¹ to 1 m d⁻¹).  
For any questions regarding the manuscript and the data, please directly contact the corresponding author, Dr. Chenxi Mi (chenxi.mi@ufz.de), once the manuscript has been accepted for publication.
